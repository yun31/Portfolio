                <em><strong>SeeTheMusic</strong></em> is an exhibition that goes beyond simply hearing sound and expands it into a visual experience, offering a new sensory perception. 
                This exhibition presents two unique artworks that allow audiences to explore the visual forms of sound, breaking away from traditional methods of listening to music.

            <section class="artwork">
                <h3>1. Hidden Harmonies: Unveiling the Soundscape</h3>
                <video controls class="artwork-video">
                    <source src="images/SeetheMusic_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    The first piece, "Hidden Harmonies: Unveiling the Soundscape," visually reveals the sounds and elements of each instrument in music that we often overlook. 
                    It breaks away from the conventional way of focusing on melody, encouraging audiences to focus on all the components that make up music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the bass is represented by vibrating light waves, drums by rhythmic dots of light, and backing sounds by flowing light curves. 
                    Each element is designed to be experienced individually and as a whole, allowing audiences to perceive music in a more layered and nuanced way.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Second Artwork -->
            <section class="artwork">
                <h3>2. Resonant Spaces: Echoes of Atmosphere</h3>
                <video controls class="artwork-video">
                    <source src="images/seethemusic_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    The second piece, "Resonant Spaces: Echoes of Atmosphere," explores the interaction between music and spatial atmosphere, offering an immersive sensory experience. 
                    Set against the backdrop of a neon-lit street at night, audiences experience a dynamic space that responds to the rhythm and sound of the music.

                <p>
                    During the bridge sections of the music, lighting changes dramatically alter the atmosphere of the space, providing an intensified audiovisual experience for the audience.
                </p>
            </section>

            <p>
                These two pieces provide a new artistic experience where sound and visuals are combined, enabling audiences not only to hear music but also to see and feel it in the space around them. 
                Dive deep into the visual landscape of sound and explore a new dimension of music in this exhibition.
