            <h1>Spaceship: Creating Immersive Spaces for Shared Memories</h1>
            <img src="images/spaceship.png" alt="Spaceship Project Image" class="project-image">
            <p>
                Spaceship redefines how we share and preserve personal memories by creating customizable 3D spaces filled with emotional and visual significance. Designed as a blend of personal storytelling 
                and social interaction, this project offers users a new way to connect through immersive environments.
            </p>

            <h3>The Concept</h3>
            <p>
                Inspired by the idea of blending "Space" and "Relationship," Spaceship allows users to arrange their memories in a 3D environment. From photos and post-its to music objects, 
                the platform enables personalization while fostering shared experiences. Users can invite friends to explore these virtual spaces, leaving messages or interacting through avatars.

            </ul>

            <h3>Design and Development</h3>
            <p>
                The project was realized using tools like Blender for 3D modeling, Unity for development. The user interface was designed to remain subtle, 
                with translucent panels ensuring the 3D space remains the focal point.
            </p>
