            <p>
                This ethnographic study delves into how university students navigate gifting in the digital era, focusing on their use of mobile gifting platforms like KakaoTalk Gift Service. 
                The research highlights the shifting dynamics of relationships and the multifaceted meaning of gifting in the context of digital interactions.
            </p>

            <h3>The Context</h3>
            <p>
                Gifting has always been a profound expression of relationships, carrying layers of social, emotional, and even economic significance. For university students, who are often navigating 
                complex social circles and financial constraints, mobile gifting offers a convenient and culturally relevant solution.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relationship Categories:</strong> Students categorize relationships into close, casual, and distant ties, each influencing their gifting choices differently.</li>
                <li><strong>Stages of Mobile Gifting:</strong> The study identified five distinct stages in the gifting process: occasion recognition, decision-making, selection, delivery, and feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital vs. Traditional Gifting:</strong> While digital platforms simplify gifting, they often lack the personal touch and immediacy of traditional methods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Mobile Gifting Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Platforms like KakaoTalk Gift Service have revolutionized how students gift, providing features like occasion reminders, AI-driven recommendations, and customizable e-cards. These 
                innovations cater to the needs of busy students, enabling them to maintain their social connections effortlessly.
            </p>

            <h3>Technological Impact</h3>
            <p>
                The convenience of mobile gifting comes with trade-offs. While it expands the reach of gifting to include distant or casual relationships, it sometimes diminishes the perceived effort 
                and emotional resonance associated with traditional gifting. This dichotomy is a central theme in the study.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Proposals</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the findings, the study proposes enhancements to mobile gifting platforms, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customizable privacy settings for gifting notifications.</li>
                <li>Improved integration of multimedia elements in digital cards to enhance emotional expression.</li>
                <li>Features to track and manage gifting history for better relationship management.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These recommendations aim to bridge the gap between convenience and emotional depth, fostering a more meaningful gifting culture in the digital age.
